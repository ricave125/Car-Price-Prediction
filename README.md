# Car-Price-Prediction
Car Price prediction using ML and DL
This project investigates the connection between a vehicles's engine horsepower(engine_hp) and its manufacturer suggested retail price(MSRP) through the application of linear regression and deep learning techniques. Using a comprehensive dataset containing various car attributes, the project seeks to determine the extent to which engine horsepower affects a vehicle's market value. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature exploration, model building, and hyperparameter tuning to build predictive models. Ultimately, the goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that explain the influence of engine performance on pricing trends, while evaluating both machine learning and deep learning methodologies for prediction accuracy.
